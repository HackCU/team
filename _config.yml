mission: "Bring people together to create, learn, and have fun!"
story: "HackCU began four years ago when a group of passionate students wanted to provide other students
   the time and space to express their crativity and work on things they usually don't get a chance to.
   Since then weâ€™ve been committed to fulfilling our mission of bringing students high-quality, inclusive
   events open to everyone irrespective of their experience."
team-description: "Our team comprises of innovative self starters who constantly want to empower the community.
    From computer scientists to entrepeneurs, our team has people of all backgrounds and experiences. An important
    element of HackCU is that all of our events are led exclusively by students. We teach and learn from our team
    members how to run and manage some of the largest technology events in the country. With this experience, our
    team members and alumni go on to work for some of the biggest names in tech and some even start their own companies."
